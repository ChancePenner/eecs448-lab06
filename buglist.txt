1. When you enqueue multiple values, peekFront() is not returning the first value. This appears to be because
   enqueue is placing the nodes in the front of the queue instead of the back.
2. Dequeue and peekFront seem to not work at times, but this is not because of errors on their part, it is
   because enquue is putting the nodes in the wrong order
3. There are memory leaks most likely due to the destructor not deleting any nodes at all. When specifically calling
   dequeue enough times to empty the queue, valgrind shows no memory leaks at all. So it seems like the destructor
   is just not calling to dequeue the entirety of the queue's length.
4. Enqueue is supposed to only take in ints, but is able to take in chars as well.
